Scenario 1:
Here I'm writing a test case to test specifically the error message(we can call kill it regression test).
Not going into the whole functionality/integration testing of each step, field, of negative/positive inputs for example
and so on.

Title - No possibility of using the same email twice
Description - open up june.dk in the browser. Could also attach some useful screenshots(e.g. login screen)
   Steps         Expected Result
1. Click on to   Login modal pops up with:
KOM I GANG       - First&Last name field
                 - Email field
                 - Checkbox

2. Enter any     Error message comes up
first and Last   saying: You cannot use 
names(this       the same email twice, 
is necessary)    please use another one.
and Email
which you used
previously and
click on START

## Third challenge / Scenario 2 manual cases:
I would use the same approach as per the solution of the 1st challenge.
Would go with a title, steps and expected result.
Steps would be the same as per automations 2nd challenge so I won't copy/paste them here.
The critical part would be checking recomendations on June Moderate Screened page by selecting 
different answers on some of the critical questions (those would be: invest amount, time horizon, risk attitude,
monthly income, monthly expense and savings) and comparing a few different flows(one with setting everything low,
another max) and checking what you get on the June Moderate Screened page.
And what I would check first, would be if going low/max has any difference on the suggestions/recommendations you get
at the very end of the flow when you get the recomendation. (There is, I've checked it)
Of course there are a few paths(few important selections) here you can take as there is a lot to take into the 
consideration what you get recommended at the very end. (From them you can get different recommendations obviously)
